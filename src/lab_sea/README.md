# Labrador Sea

This repo contains scripts for scientific research and reporting on the 
Labrador Sea using Argo float data.

For 2024 this will tentatively include the following:

- T/S/rho maps and time series
- Depth thresholds: surface (<50 dbar), 100-500 dbar, 500-1000 dbar, 1000-2000 dbar
- Seasonal cycles / timeseries
- MLD, stratification index

Exact depth thresholds and geographic definition of the Labrador Sea to be determined.
